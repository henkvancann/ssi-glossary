## More

Multiple forms of a single ACDC can be called the "most compact" version, given that each level of [graduated disclosure](graduated-disclosure) will have a "most compacted" version. If all the blocks are expanded to a most compact version, then it becomes fully expanded. If all the blocks are replaced with SAIDs then it becomes fully compacted. 

This form is a part of the graduated disclosure objective.
