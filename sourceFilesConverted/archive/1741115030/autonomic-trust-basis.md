## Other trust bases
Two other trust bases are in common use for identifier systems. One we call *algorithmic*, the other is . 

An algorithmic trust basis relies on some network of nodes running some type of Byzantine fault tolerant totally ordering distributed consensus algorithm for its root-of-trust. These networks are more commonly known as a shared ledger or blockchain such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Sovrin

The other commonly used trust basis in identifier systems is an *administrative* or organizational *trust basis*, i.e. a trusted entity. This is neither [secure](security) nor [decentralized](decentralized-identifier).
