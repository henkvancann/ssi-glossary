## Assign tasks but stay in control
Delegation can be defined as “the act of empowering to act for another”. With this bestowed power, a person, usually a subordinate, is able to carry out specific activities (normally given by a manager or supervisor). Delegation is a management tool designed to increase the efficiency of an organization. It allows for the goals of the organization to be broken down into tasks and assigned to the team member best suited for the duty.
