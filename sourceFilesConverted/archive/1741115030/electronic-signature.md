## Digital signature implementation of e-signatures

_Electronic_ signatures are a legal concept _distinct_ from **[digital signatures](digital-signature), a cryptographic mechanism** often used to implement electronic signatures. While an electronic signature can be as simple as a name entered in an electronic document, digital signatures are increasingly used in e-commerce and in regulatory filings to implement electronic signatures in a cryptographically protected way.
