## More

To elaborate, in a [cooperative delegation](cooperative-delegation), the key generation and storage functions of the delegator and delegate, in terms of controlling private keys, may be completely isolated from each other. This means that each may use its own independent key management infrastructure with no movement of private keys between the two infrastructures. We call this a **bivalent** key management infrastructure.
