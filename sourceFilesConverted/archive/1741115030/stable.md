## Examples

An identifier is considered stable when its associated event sequence (establishment, rotations, etc.) has been published by sufficient witnesses so that it can be verified and acknowledged by a quorum of watchers.

After a key rotation event, the new keys are considered stable only when enough receipts from witnesses confirm the event.
