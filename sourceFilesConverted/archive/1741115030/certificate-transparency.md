## 2011 Diginotar Attack
Certificate Transparency was a response to the 2011 attack on DigiNotar and other Certificate Authorities. These attacks showed that the lack of transparency in the way CAs operated was a significant risk to the Web Public Key Infrastructure. It led to the creation of this ambitious project to improve security online by bringing accountability to the system that protects HTTPS.
