The more important criteria are:
- Standard Format: MIME types must adhere to the format type/subtype
- Registered with IANA: Although, ideally, MIME types should be registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ([IANA](IANA)), ensuring they are part of a recognized standard, we consider Experimental or Proposed MIME types as being a valid MIME type as well.
