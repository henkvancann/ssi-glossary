## How it works
Applications donâ€™t store passwords in plaintext, but instead encrypt passwords using [hashes](content-addressable-hash). After the user enters their password to login, it is converted to hashes, and the result is compared with the stored hashes on the server to look for a match. If they match, the user is [authenticated](authenticity) and able to log in.
