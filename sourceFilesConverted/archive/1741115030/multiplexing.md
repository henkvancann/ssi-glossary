## CESR related
Because of [count codes](count-code) and the [composability](composability) - and [concatenation](concatenation) property in CESR, [pipelining](pipelining) is possible, which then uses _multiplexing_ (combining [self-framing](self-framing) primitives) and _de-multiplexing_ (unravelling self-framing [primitives](primitive)). The addition of group framing codes as independently composable primitives enables [hierarchical compositions](hierarchical-composition).
