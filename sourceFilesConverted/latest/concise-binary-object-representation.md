## Explanation
It is a binary data [serialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization) format loosely based on [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) authored by C. Bormann. Like JSON it allows the transmission of data objects that contain [nameâ€“value pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute%E2%80%93value_pair), but in a more concise manner. This increases processing and transfer speeds at the cost of [human readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-readable_medium). 

It is defined in IETF [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier)) [8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBOR#cite_note-:0-1)

CBOR was inspired by [MessagePack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MessagePack), which was developed and promoted by Sadayuki Furuhashi. CBOR extended MessagePack, particularly by allowing to distinguish text strings from byte strings, which was implemented in 2013 in MessagePack.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBOR#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBOR#cite_note-rfc8949-5)
