## Term Definition

## Limitation
Those oobis would still need a way to authorize the endpoint provider, the endpoint role, for each of the different things. A multi-sig becomes a messy collaboration effort, especially when you take into account signing at the edge. You would need an authorization record for each end-point. And then pass this to all the members and ask them to collaborate.
