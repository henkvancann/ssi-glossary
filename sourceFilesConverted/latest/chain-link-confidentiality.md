## Term Definition

Spec-Up-T link: <a href='https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/chain-link-confidentiality'>here</a>

## Contrast
Disclosures via [Presentations Exchanges](presentation-exchange) may be contractually protected by Chain-Link Confidentiality (i.e. a Chain-Link Confidential disclosure). The chaining in this case is different from the chaining described above between Issuances in a [DAG](directed-acyclic-graph) of chained Issuances. Chain-link confidentiality, in contrast, chains together a sequence of Disclosees.
