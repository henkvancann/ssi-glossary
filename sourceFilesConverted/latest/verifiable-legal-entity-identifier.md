### Explanation
The v in vLEI stands for “verifiable”, but what does that mean? In this case, "verifiable" comes from “Verifiable Credential”. A verifiable credential is just a collection of information with a mechanism that allows a computer to verify that the information has not been modified and that the information was originally stated to be correct by some third party (maybe a bank or the driving license authority). Often (almost always really), the information will include a link to the entity the information is about.
