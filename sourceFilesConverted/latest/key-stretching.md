## Humans are predictable
Passwords or passphrases created by humans are often short or predictable enough to allow [password cracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking), and key stretching is intended to make such attacks more difficult by complicating a basic step of trying a single password candidate. Key stretching also improves security in some real-world applications where the key length has been constrained, by mimicking a longer key length from the perspective of a brute-force attacker.
