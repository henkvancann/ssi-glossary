## KERI multi-signatures
The KERI team has conceptually chosen for minimal sufficient means and so-called _dumb crypto_: "'Dumb technology' is freely available, understandable to everyone and easy to implement. In our case: just hashes and digital signatures."

KERI has thresholded set of [non-repudiable](non-repudiable) signatures.  
KERI's CESR, and therefore KERI and ACDC is extensible with the latest more sophisticated multi-signature schemes like Schnorr signatures.
