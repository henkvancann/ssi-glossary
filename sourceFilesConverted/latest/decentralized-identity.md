`KERI`s definition of decentralization (centralization) is about _control_ not _spatial distribution_. In our definition _decentralized_ is not necessarily the same as _distributed_. By distributed we mean that activity happens at more than one site. Thus decentralization is about _control_ and distribution is about _place_. To elaborate, when we refer to decentralized infrastructure we mean infrastructure under decentralized (centralized) control no matter its spatial distribution. Thus _decentralized infrastructure_ is infrastructure sourced or controlled by more than one `entity`.
