## Example
A blind OOBI through an AID that is on some witness list and has been verified to root-of-trust already. So you know the human being behind this referred AID. Because it's an AID that has a [KEL](KEL) out there, which has been securely established, you can trust it. So a blind OOBI makes a via-via commitment. 

A natural person that you trust is an owner of an AID. Then you cryptographically commit this AID to another AID through some mechanism (e.g. a witness list).

> "Here's my public key and here's my AID and because this in an another witness list I trust it."

A 'blind' AID becomes "unblind" when you establish a direct relationship with human being who controls the referenced AID. You shortcut the blind OOBI because you established a direct OOBI to the formerly reference AID.
