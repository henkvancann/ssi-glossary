### More on Wikipedia
[Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory))

The term entropy is also used to describe the degree of unpredictability of a message. Entropy is then measured in bits. The degree or strength of randomness determines how difficult it would be for someone else to reproduce the same large random number. This is called _collision resistance_.
