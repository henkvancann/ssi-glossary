```

All encoded as [qualified](qualified) [base64](base64).  A verifier would then know to use the AIDâ€™s public key located at index 3 in the list of public keys to verify the signature.

In addition, [witness](witness) signatures can also be attached as indexed signatures. So a verifier can determine which witness signed a particular [receipt](receipt). This is useful when witnesses are receipting an event and only attaching their own signature. The [controller](controller) knows which witness signed the receipt by looking up the index in their list of witnesses for that event.
