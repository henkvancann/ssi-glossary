### Meaning
A _liveness_ property in concurrent systems states that "something good will eventually occur".

Liveness guarantees are important properties in operating systems and distributed systems.  
Unlike liveness properties, [safety properties](#safety-properties) can be violated by a finite execution of a distributed system. All properties can be expressed as the intersection of safety and liveness properties.
