A virtual credential typically refers to a type of credential that exists in a digital or online form, often without a physical counterpart. It can be a digital representation of a claim or an identity attribute (such as name, age, professional certification, etc.) that is issued, stored, and shared electronically. The term "virtual" here emphasizes that the credential exists only in digital form and may not be physically printed or tangible.
