## Broader context

A URL is a specific type of [Uniform Resource Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) (URI),although many people use the two terms interchangeably. URLs occur most commonly to reference [web pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page) ([HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)) but are also used for file transfer ([FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol)), email ([mailto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailto)), database access ([JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity)), and many other applications.
