## Why a directed acyclic graph (DAG)

Following directions in a DAG will never form a closed loop. Steps through a DAG are finite. That's the main reason to choose for a DAG.


From Wikipedia ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)):

A directed graph is a DAG if and only if it can be [topologically ordered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_ordering), by arranging the vertices as a linear ordering that is consistent with all edge directions. 


From Wikipedia ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)):

DAGs have numerous scientific and computational applications, ranging from biology (evolution, family trees, epidemiology) to information science (citation networks) to computation (scheduling).
