## Broader definition 
A trust domain is a domain that the system trusts to authenticate users. In other words, if a user or application is authenticated by a trusted domain, this authentication is accepted by all domains that trust the authenticating domain.

A more technical meaning of 'domain' is on the internet: [domain name](domain-name).
