# Self-Sovereign Identity Glossary

This glossary is the home for all KERI related SSI terms in the own scope of the KERI creators.

## Other glossaries and scopes

The KERI Suite is related to these glossaries:

[ToIP main glossary](https://glossary.trustoverip.org)

[ToIP general IT-terms glossary](https://trustoverip.github.io/ctwg-general-glossary)

[KERI Suite main glossary](https://weboftrust.github.io/kerisuite-glossary)

vLEI glossary: planned for April 2025

Each one of these glossaries has their own mental model or scope. This means that we've only decided where a certain term could find their home. All glossaries above are Spec-Up-T based; which means that the content is version managed and all the references to those glossaries can be monitored through time as long as the commit chain is not broken in each repository.

## Spec-Up-T

*Spec-Up* started as a **one-page static website page specification tool** at DIF for technical documentation. It had basic option for defining terms (using the `[[Def:` tag) and referring (using the `[[Ref:` tag) to them, in the same document only.

*Spec-Up-T* with T for "Terminology" and/or "TrustoverIP" has added:
- version management per term definition
- `[[Xref:` tag to reference to other Spec-Up(-T) based specifications; an eXternal reference
- `[[Tref:` tag to type out the external term definition in th own document for documentation purposes
- fixed and standardized urls to the term definitions f the form `http://{user}.github.io/{glossary}/term:{term}`
- Spec-Up-T build consensus among glossaries based on the technology because cross-references are possible and can be monitored and synced continuously if necessary or wanted

### Glossary-only specifications

Currently we broadly see two types of Spec-Up-T end-products:
- a **specification** with a small term definition section that will link to more instances of
- a full **glossary** with a small content section
